# MongoDB Basics: Quick Notes for Beginners

## What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a **NoSQL database** that stores data in **JSON-like documents**. It is flexible, fast, and ideal for modern applications.

## Key Features of MongoDB:
1. **Document-Oriented**: Stores data in intuitive JSON-like documents, which makes it easy to work with complex data structures.
2. **Schema-Less**: Collections can contain documents with varying structures, providing flexibility.
3. **Horizontal Scalability**: Data is distributed across servers using **sharding**, improving performance and reliability.
4. **Rich Query Language**: Supports powerful queries, aggregations, and real-time analytics for enhanced data processing.

## MongoDB vs. Relational Databases:

| **Feature**       | **Relational Database**        | **MongoDB**                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Storage**        | Tables (rows & columns)       | JSON-like documents         |
| **Schema**         | Fixed                         | Flexible                    |
| **Scaling**        | Vertical                      | Horizontal (sharding)       |
| **Joins**          | Complex                       | Embedded documents          |
| **Best For**       | Structured data               | Semi/unstructured data      |

### Example: Storing Student Information
- **Relational Database**:  

  | Roll No | Name          | Courses             |  
  |---------|---------------|---------------------|  
  | 101     | Jenil Sharma  | DBMS, Algorithms    |  

- **MongoDB Document**:  
  ```json
  {
    "roll_number": 101,
    "name": "Jenil Sharma",
    "courses": ["DBMS", "Algorithms"]
  }
